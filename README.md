# esp-comm

This component is a collection of objects to ease Wifi comms in projects.

I created it in order not to keep reinventing the wheel each time a project needs IP features over Wifi, like a tiny web interface to set up a wifi password, TCP or UDP clients, UPnP, etc...

Most of the code is mine, possibly occasionally flawed, and UPnP is adapted from TinyUPnP.
